# CHICKEN INVADERS

A Chicken Invaders game developed in C++, using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics, audio, and event handling. The game is a fun, arcade-style shooter where players must defend their spaceship from waves of invading chickens, with increasing difficulty as the game progresses.

The project follows structured programming principles, focusing on simplicity, modularity, and readability. The codebase is organized into functions and modules, avoiding complex OOP features for a straightforward and approachable design.
